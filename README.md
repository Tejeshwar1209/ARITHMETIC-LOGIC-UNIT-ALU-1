##Designed a basic 4-bit ALU using Verilog HDL as part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD. The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations including Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. A Verilog testbench was developed to verify functionality using simulation tools like ModelSim/Vivado. The project includes Verilog code, simulation results, and a detailed PDF report. This task enhanced my understanding of digital logic design, hardware description languages, and VLSI design flow.
